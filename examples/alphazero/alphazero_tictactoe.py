    "Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm"

    "Mastering the Game of Go without Human Knowledge"
    Silver et al., Nature 2017 (AlphaGo Zero)

Algorithm Summary:
    AlphaZero is a general reinforcement learning algorithm for two-player zero-sum games
    that learns entirely through self-play, starting from random initial weights without
    any domain-specific human knowledge or demonstration data.

TODO: In my own words. This is AI Generated
Key Contributions & Ideas:
    1. Tabula Rasa Self-Play: The agent plays games against itself using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a single deep neural network. The neural network learns from the outcomes of its own self-play games.
    2. Dual-Head Neural Network f_theta(s) = (p, v): A single network takes board representations and outputs both a policy vector p (prior probabilities for all possible moves) and a scalar value prediction v in [-1, +1] estimating expected outcome from the current player's perspective.
    3. MCTS as Policy Improvement: MCTS search uses network predictions (p, v) to guide node selection (PUCT algorithm). The visit count distribution pi at the root after search acts as a strongly improved policy target compared to raw network priors p.
    4. Policy Iteration Loop:
       - Self-Play: Execute MCTS to generate games, storing (s_t, pi_t, z_t) tuples where z_t is the final outcome (-1, 0, +1) relative to player at turn t.
       - Network Optimization: Train (p, v) by minimizing combined cross-entropy policy loss and MSE value loss: L = (z - v)^2 - pi^T * log(p) + c||theta||^2.

Differences in this Implementation:
    - Environment: Uses PettingZoo's `tictactoe_v3` environment for evaluation and self-play.
    - Lightweight Dynamics: Inlines a fast 9-cell 3x3 board simulator for MCTS tree transitions,
      avoiding environment copy overhead during search.
    - All-in-one Self-Contained Example: Includes network, dynamics simulator, loss function,
      self-play collector, replay buffer, and baseline evaluation harness.

NOTE: We do not follow the convention of using the gym env as a simulator and encourage the user to extract the dynamics from the env and attempt to remove unecessary overhead to improve the training speed and MCTS speed. Although it may be possible, AlphaZero is not the focus of the library, as mentioned below, and some environments from PettingZoo and Gym can have trouble with copy operations leading to courrupted data.

NOTE: Focus of the library (when it comes to search based algos) is not on AlphaZero-like algorithms, but MuZero-like ones. This is here as a stepping stone for people looking to understand MuZero better, but in general I encourage you to look into model learned algorithms (like Dreamerv3, MuZero, etc.) over model given ones.

TODO: some hyperparameter tuning. it works well, but still loses sometimes to a random bot, which i remember when i had muzero working on the older library never happened. I imagine alphazero should be better.

TODO: training on a similarly sized model takes way longer than it did before. figure out why and how the current system can be improved and optimized to run faster. a training run used to take about 20 minutes for 20k steps on MuZero with 3 Resnet blocks per component and 24 filters each, batch size 8, 25 simulations, 3 torch mp actor processes, and batched mcts with a search batch size of 5, also unroll of 5. now its well over an hour, probably over 2 with the alphazero params which should be faster in terms of wall clock time. on mac on cpu

TODO: why didn't we use any of our returns.py or returns/ folder or whatever (compute_mc_return fn). is it because we are not working on whole game sequences? should we update to use that?
