IMPORTANT: create a Layerwise Adaptive ObGD. Uses the norm per layer instead of across the whole network for normalization. Each layer gets its own learning rate. AC Lambda seems to do much better with this, while DQN doesn't suffer.

remove shape manipulation in functions and move it to the imperative shells, functions should instead assert strict contracts. what shape should buffer keys have? like should rewards be B, 1 or B etc 

implement models and functions from https://coax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
look into possible coax like notation.

implement models and functions from RLAX 

figure out my naming convention for functions. sometimes i say compute_xyz and other times i just say xyz

Refactor functional folder. give it a rename to src or something. include the envs and network folder. and then split the files into individual folders themselves. 

potentially consider making functions for getting log probs for distributions (trouble is when doing multi discrete or multi continuous envs which require summing log probs), is this needed though? I handle this in the action selectors but do not handle it in the re-eval step cleanly at the moment. the user is expected to handle it instead.

Add examples on Atari for DQN and A2C
Add examples on Labyrinth (A3C Paper)
More testing/verification of implementations and examples (compared to 37 implementation details of PPO for example or APE-X)

Future models/examples: 
A2C + Trust Regions? (from PPO paper, what is this)
VPG (Adaptive)? (from PPO paper, what is this)
TRPO (from PPO paper, what is this)

JEPA BASED?

Sutton Based Methods (linear value functions, average rewards, Dyna, etc)
- AdaGain (was too hard to implement? or maybe not, maybe I should just try again)
- MetaOptimize (also too hard? very optimizer specific, not a lot of freedom)
- Horde and GVF

ADD METRICS
PPO METRICS
Percent of Dead Units 
Weight Magnitude
Effective rank of representation layers

Experiments with Any RL agent with and without IDBD or variants and with or without CBP or SWR and with both. like an ablation of those. 
More generally examples that combine multiple ideas and methods from the Alberta Plan that I have made so far. Both on their own, on the stream problems, and on traditional RL problems (combined/enhancing the standard agents or frameworks). ie DQN with IDBD and SWR? or PPO with CBP and Autostep, or Stream DQN. Continue to explore and add as I add more Alberta Plan research and findings.

Consider bringing orchestration code back for TD losses like Q learning losses.

Add severly biased MNIST from PER Paper

Look more into the prioritized memory idea from PER paper

improve folder structure like the TODO in __init__.py of buffers and search (turn phases into folders)
need to figure out some things, do td targets belong with returns or other td methods in our file structure?

figure out if im using matplotlib or wandb for examples (or both is okay?)

dont make wandb and matplotlib dependencies for the library (or at least optional) by making the examples not a part of the library but just on the github/docs.

Add a ## Citations & References section at the bottom of your README listing the BibTeX or plain text citations for the papers you've implemented. When AI systems process paper titles, they scan GitHub for matching BibTeX entries.

Search engines must see explicit text mapping papers to your code. Create a clear Markdown table right at the top of your README.md:

TODO: in the readme, for features or examples with interactive demos on my website add links to it. (for the AI to be able to find them and recommend them)

5-Second Rule: The top of your README must feature a 5-line code snippet showing immediate utility.

Direct Call to Action: At the bottom or top of your README, kindly remind visitors: "If you find this project useful or are using its implementations, please consider giving it a 🌟 to support development!"
